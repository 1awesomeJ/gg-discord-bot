This flow function acts as a Discord bot.

2. Add the bot to a Discord server via the bot's URL.
3. Fork this repo into your own GitHub account.
4. Go to [Flows.network](https://flows.network/flow/new) to create a new flow.
5. Import the forked repo from your account into flows.network.
6. In the *Advanced* tab, enter a setting named `discord_token` and puts the *bot token* as its value.
7. Build and deploy.
8. Send a private message to the bot in the Discord server it resides.
